### ðŸ”§ Phase 2: Full Features (Weeks 5-8)

- [ ] All pass types (restroom, parking, multi-stop)
- [ ] Escalation and notification system
- [x] Reporting and analytics
- [ ] 80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] E2E tests for core flows

### âœ¨ Phase 3: Polish & Deploy (Weeks 9-12)

- [ ] Complete E2E test suite
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation (technical + user)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Production deployment

### ðŸ“Š Phase 4: Post-Launch (Ongoing)

- [ ] Monitoring and alerts
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] Bug fixes and patches
- [ ] Feature enhancements

## Current Status

**Test Coverage:** 48.38%

### âœ… Completed

- Project setup and configuration
- Testing framework (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- Firebase integration
- Initial components (CheckInButton, PassForm, ReturnButton)
- Authentication system (Google SSO, role management)
- Pass lifecycle (create, check-in/out, close)
- Location and schedule management
- Escalation and group management
- Reporting & analytics features
- Component library completed
- Global state management implemented
- PWA functionality (service worker, offline, install prompts)
- Firestore schema configured (collections, indexes, rules)
- Cloud Functions implemented for pass management and integrations
- Security features implemented (PII masking, audit trail, role-based access)

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Increase test coverage (current 48.38%)


### ðŸ“‹ Todo (High Priority)

1. Finalize advanced pass lifecycle features
2. ~~Implement user role system~~ (completed)
3. ~~Create location management~~ (completed)
4. ~~Build escalation system~~ (completed)
5. Achieve 80% test coverage

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% coverage)

- [x] Services: auth, pass, schedule, location, group
- [ ] Components: forms, displays, navigation
- [ ] Utilities: validation, formatting, permissions
- [ ] Hooks: auth, real-time data, forms

### E2E Tests (Cypress)

- [ ] Authentication flows (all roles)
- [ ] Complete pass lifecycle
- [ ] Permission scenarios
- [ ] Data import/export
- [ ] Mobile interactions

### Performance Tests

- [ ] 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] <3 second page loads
- [ ] Real-time update latency
- [ ] Report generation speed

## Key Deliverables

1. **Functional Application**
   - All PRD features implemented
   - FERPA compliant
   - Mobile-responsive PWA

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - 80% unit test coverage
   - Complete E2E test suite
   - Security audit passed

3. **Documentation**
   - Technical documentation
   - User guides for all roles
   - API documentation

4. **Infrastructure**
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Staging environment
   - Production deployment

## Risk Areas

### Technical

- Real-time sync performance at scale
- Complex permission hierarchies
- FERPA compliance in exports

### Timeline

- Scope creep from additional features
- Integration complexity with school systems
- Testing time for edge cases

### Mitigation

- Early performance testing
- Incremental feature releases
- Continuous security reviews
- Regular stakeholder check-ins
