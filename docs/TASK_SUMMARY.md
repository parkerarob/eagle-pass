# Eagle Pass - Task Summary

## Quick Overview
Total estimated completion time: 12 weeks
Target test coverage: 80%
E2E test coverage: Complete user flows

## Major Milestones

### ðŸš€ Phase 1: Core MVP (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Authentication system (Google SSO)
- [ ] Basic pass lifecycle (create, check-in/out, close)
- [ ] Student and teacher interfaces
- [ ] Basic unit tests (>50% coverage)

### ðŸ”§ Phase 2: Full Features (Weeks 5-8) 
- [ ] All pass types (restroom, parking, multi-stop)
- [ ] Escalation and notification system
- [ ] Reporting and analytics
- [ ] 80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] E2E tests for core flows

### âœ¨ Phase 3: Polish & Deploy (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] Complete E2E test suite
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation (technical + user)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Production deployment

### ðŸ“Š Phase 4: Post-Launch (Ongoing)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] Bug fixes and patches
- [ ] Feature enhancements

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- Project setup and configuration
- Testing framework (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- Basic Firebase integration
- Initial components (CheckInButton, PassForm, ReturnButton)
- Authentication setup started

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Pass service implementation (~29% tested)
- Component development
- Firebase schema design

### ðŸ“‹ Todo (High Priority)
1. Complete pass lifecycle logic
2. Implement user role system
3. Create location management
4. Build escalation system
5. Achieve 80% test coverage

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (Target: 80% coverage)
- [ ] Services: auth, pass, schedule, location, group
- [ ] Components: forms, displays, navigation
- [ ] Utilities: validation, formatting, permissions
- [ ] Hooks: auth, real-time data, forms

### E2E Tests (Cypress)
- [ ] Authentication flows (all roles)
- [ ] Complete pass lifecycle
- [ ] Permission scenarios
- [ ] Data import/export
- [ ] Mobile interactions

### Performance Tests
- [ ] 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] <3 second page loads
- [ ] Real-time update latency
- [ ] Report generation speed

## Key Deliverables

1. **Functional Application**
   - All PRD features implemented
   - FERPA compliant
   - Mobile-responsive PWA

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - 80% unit test coverage
   - Complete E2E test suite
   - Security audit passed

3. **Documentation**
   - Technical documentation
   - User guides for all roles
   - API documentation

4. **Infrastructure**
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Staging environment
   - Production deployment

## Risk Areas

### Technical
- Real-time sync performance at scale
- Complex permission hierarchies
- FERPA compliance in exports

### Timeline
- Scope creep from additional features
- Integration complexity with school systems
- Testing time for edge cases

### Mitigation
- Early performance testing
- Incremental feature releases
- Continuous security reviews
- Regular stakeholder check-ins
