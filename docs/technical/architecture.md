# Architecture Diagrams

The Eagle Pass system follows a client–server architecture:

1. **Frontend** – React PWA built with Vite and Tailwind.
2. **Backend** – Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions).
3. **CI/CD** – GitHub Actions pipelines, as described in `docs/ci-cd.md`.

Diagrams are stored in the `/docs/diagrams` directory (to be created) and include component relationships and data flow.
