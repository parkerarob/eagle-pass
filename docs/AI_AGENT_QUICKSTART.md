# AI Agent Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome, AI Agent! This guide will get you up and running with the Eagle Pass development workflow in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure:
- [ ] Node.js and npm are installed
- [ ] Git is configured with your credentials
- [ ] You have push access to the repository
- [ ] All tests are currently passing (`npm test`)

## Step 1: Initialize Your Environment

```bash
# Run the initialization script
npm run agent:init
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Verify project state
- üåø Create a development branch
- üìù Set up logging system
- üíæ Create initial commit

## Step 2: Understand Your Task List

Open `docs/PROJECT_COMPLETION_TASKS.md` and find your starting point:

**Priority Order:**
1. **Section 1.1**: Authentication & User Management
2. **Section 1.2**: Pass Lifecycle Implementation
3. **Section 1.3**: Location Management
4. **Section 1.4**: Schedule Management

## Step 3: Execute Your First Task

### Task Pattern (follow this for EVERY task):

```
1. üìã Read task requirements
2. üîß Plan implementation
3. üíª Write code
4. üß™ Run tests
5. üìù Update docs
6. ÔøΩÔøΩ Commit & push
```

### Example Workflow:

```bash
# Start working on authentication
cd src/services
# Create/edit auth.ts

# Write tests first (TDD approach)
# Create auth.test.ts

# Run tests as you develop
npm test -- --watch auth.test.ts

# Once task is complete
npm run agent:complete
```

## Step 4: Documentation Updates (CRITICAL!)

After EVERY task, update these files:

1. **Mark task complete** in `PROJECT_COMPLETION_TASKS.md`
2. **Update progress** in `TASK_SUMMARY.md`
3. **Add to agent log** (automated by scripts)
4. **Update technical docs** if needed

## Step 5: Git Workflow

### Commit Message Format:
```
feat: [SECTION] - [TASK_NAME]

[DETAILED_DESCRIPTION]

Tests: [TEST_STATUS]
Coverage: [OLD]% -> [NEW]%
```

### Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: 1.1 - Complete Google SSO Integration

- Implemented authentication service
- Added user role checking
- Created auth context provider
- Added error handling for auth failures

Tests: All passing
Coverage: 24.5% -> 31.2%"
```

## Critical Success Factors

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Run tests after every change
- Update docs before committing
- Follow the task execution pattern
- Commit frequently with good messages
- Track progress in the log files

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Skip validation steps
- Commit broken code
- Work on multiple tasks simultaneously
- Forget to update documentation
- Push without running tests

## Monitoring Your Progress

### Coverage Target: 80%
```bash
# Check current coverage
npm run coverage:check

# View detailed coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Task Completion Rate
- **Goal**: 2-3 subtasks per development session
- **Track**: Update agent log daily
- **Review**: Check task summary weekly

## Emergency Procedures

### If Tests Fail:
```bash
# 1. Check what's broken
npm test -- --reporter=verbose

# 2. Fix systematically
# Focus on one failing test at a time

# 3. Verify fix doesn't break others
npm test
```

### If Stuck:
1. Document the blocker in agent log
2. Research the issue thoroughly
3. Try alternative approaches
4. Skip to next independent task if needed

### If Coverage Drops:
```bash
# Identify untested code
npm run test:coverage

# Write tests for new code
# Focus on services and utilities first
```

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev                 # Start dev server
npm test                   # Run all tests
npm run test:ui            # Interactive test UI
npm run lint               # Check code quality

# AI Agent Scripts
npm run agent:init         # Initialize environment
npm run agent:complete     # Mark task complete
npm run coverage:check     # Check coverage progress

# Git Operations
git status                 # Check current state
git add .                  # Stage changes
git commit -m "message"    # Commit with message
git push                   # Push to remote
```

## Documentation Map

- **Main Task List**: `docs/PROJECT_COMPLETION_TASKS.md`
- **Progress Overview**: `docs/TASK_SUMMARY.md`
- **Detailed Workflow**: `docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`
- **Testing Guide**: `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
- **Agent Log**: `docs/AGENT_LOG_[DATE].md` (created by init script)

## Success Metrics

### Daily Goals:
- [ ] Complete 2-3 subtasks
- [ ] Maintain or improve test coverage
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Create meaningful commits

### Weekly Goals:
- [ ] Complete 1-2 major sections
- [ ] Achieve 5-10% coverage improvement
- [ ] Update progress summaries
- [ ] Review and plan next phase

### Project Goals:
- [ ] 80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] All features implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Production-ready application

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs**: Review error messages carefully
2. **Consult documentation**: All procedures are documented
3. **Test systematically**: Isolate the problem
4. **Document blockers**: Record issues for future reference

## Ready to Start? üöÄ

1. Run `npm run agent:init`
2. Open `docs/PROJECT_COMPLETION_TASKS.md`
3. Find Section 1.1: Authentication & User Management
4. Begin with the first subtask
5. Follow the task execution pattern

**Remember**: Quality over speed. Better to complete fewer tasks correctly than rush through many with poor quality.

Happy coding, AI Agent! ü§ñ
